      <h1>Welcome plant lovers around the world !</h1>
      <p>In this site you will find all about plants. Plants help us to make the air cleaner and make our spaces happier,
        so we want to help you find the right one for you. <br /> You will find information about all the different types of plants,
        and some guidance to take care of them.</p>
      <p> With this info you will see that you don't need a great amount of &#36;&#36;&#36; to take care of your plants, and that you are not a plant killer
        (in case you have tried before...and it didn't end well)</p>

    <h2>Cheat table for newbies</h2>
    <p>Some plants are easy to take care of them, and some of them will have you praying that they don't die. But, you don't have to worry,
      with this table you will have the basic information you need to remind you how frequent you need to water and fertilize your plants depending
      on the exposure to the Sun. You will see how they react to this schedule and if your plant doesn't like it, it will give you signs that something is
      not working. With time, you will be an expert in recognizing signs from your plant, but you need patience.</p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>Sun exposure</td>
        <td>Water</td>
        <td>Fertilizer</td>

    <h2>Plant Shops in Lima</h2>
    <p>Buying plants could become a nightmare if you don't search for a good place. When you buy plants you can't easily notice if they are healthy or
      if they are infected by some bug or disease, so you will need to check the leaves in order to know if they are healthy.<br />
      Sometimes it happens that you take your new plant to your house, and it starts dying a week after even if you had properly taken care of them.<br />
      If you are interested in buying a new plant and don{t have these problems, I recommend you visiting and shopping in this plant stores.</p>

    <p>There is one variety of plants that is a good one if you want to start in plant world. <b>Succulents</b>
      If you want to learn more of them, click <a href="index2.page2.html" target="_blank">here</a> </p>

    <p>My final recommendation to start taking care of your plants, is to buy a clay pot, like the ones in this picture.<br />
      The material, is perfect because it helps to absorb the water they need and evaporates the water they don't, but also helps retains humidity
      until the next water day.</p>
